# udacity-bertelsmann-scholarship

The scholarship challenge started in December 2020 and ran until March 2021. This was phase 1 which ran for 3 months and was called "Introduction to AI in Business." Those that made it to phase 2 of the scholarship are allowed able to submit the projects for grading until September 2021 and get the full "AI for Product Manager" nanodegree certificate. This phase 2 ran for 6 months but I completed in 2 months because I already completed the three projects in phase 1 before that. There were three projects.

1. Create a Medical Image Annotation Job

This project was about designing an annotation job on the Appen platform for labeling by external annotators/contractors. The job consists of labeling x-ray images of children lungs that are healthy and those with pneumonia. The intent is to build a classification system to identify healthy or sick cases. For this project, we were graded on the submitted Udacity questionaire and the design of the annotation job. The Appen job was not actually processed as that would incur costs. We designed the questionaire using dataset downloaded from Kaggle and Appen's CML(Custom Markup Language).

Here are my graded submissions:

2. Create a Medical Image Annotation Job

This project was about designing different models to classify the images labelled by annotators. We have to build and train 4 model classifiers using Google AutoML Visio in order to help doctors quickly identify x-ray images as normal or with pneumonia. I had to subscribed to Google Cloud Platform in order to train my 4 models including: 

Create a binary classifier to detect pneumonia using chest x-rays; 
Create an unbalanced binary classifier;
Create a binary classifier with dirty data; and
Create a three-class model with the classes “normal”, “bacterial pneumonia”, and “viral pneumonia”.

3. Capstone Project: Create an AI Product Business Proposal

This capstone project was about designing a business proposal, describing what it will do, and why/how this helps the business. The following 6 questions below were submitted in the report and had to use confusion matrix, wireframing software like Figma, use cases/personas, choice of labels/features for data, and designing for longevity. The product did not have to be developed as part of the capstone, but the business proposal was needed to simulate submission for approval to stakeholders.

And finally, here is my final [graduation certificate](https://confirm.udacity.com/YKACEDTT) from Udacity.
