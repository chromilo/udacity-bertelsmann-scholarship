# udacity-bertelsmann-scholarship

The scholarship challenge started in December 2020 and ran until March 2021. Those that made it to phase 2 of the scholarship are allowed able to submit the projects for grading until September 2021 and get the nanodegree certificate. That's a total of 9 months for the AI Product Manager nanodegree. There were three projects.

1. Create a Medical Image Annotation Job

This project was about designing an annotation job on the Appen platform for labeling by external annotators. The job consists of x-ray images of children lungs from healthy and sick patients. The intent is to build a classification system to can identify healthy or sick cases. For this project, we were graded on the submitted Udacity questionaire and the design of the annotation job. The Appen job was not actually processed as that would incur costs. We designed the questionaire using dataset downloaded from Kaggle and Appen's CML(Custom Markup Language).

Here are my graded submissions:
